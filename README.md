# Streamlabs iOS App Assignment

## Introduction
Hi there! We are happy you are interested in joining the mobile engineering team here at Streamlabs. We are on a mission of building tools to help content creators around the world grow, and we are excited to have you on board.

We believe it is important that our assessment of your skills matches the technical challenges you will face as an engineer at the company. Please carve out approximately 2-3 hours for this assignment. 

## Objective
The main goal of this assignment is to build a simple demo application that contains two screens: video feed and user profile.

Video feed shows a full screen video that is loaded from a url. 

* Users can swipe up and down to navigate through the feed vertically.
* Implementing a video cache is not required.
* You should parse `videos.json` that has a list of the videos that the user can scroll through.

User profile shows basic information about the user: profile picture, user name etc. 

* Please find an example user profile UI in `user_photo.png`. 
* You should parse `user.json` to retrieve mock data for the user profile.

## Recommendations

* Preferred language: Swift
* Preferred architecture: Anything except MVC
* Please architecture as you would a production app
* Using third-party libraries is allowed

## Result
* Demo app
* Readme file with key decisions that were made during the creation of the demo app
	* System design choices
	* Anything else you find important

## What we are looking for
While the hard requirements of this assignment are somewhat basic, we are looking for assignments that display a deep understanding of Swift and an ability to write clean and scalable code. The infrastructure should be easily able to potentially handle future feature requirements such as the following:

* Video caching
* Uploading new videos
* Editing user profile
* Interacting with videos: like, share, comment etc.
* Drag-to-refresh

The 2-3 hours time requirement is not a hard stop, and was determined with an assumption of previous basic knowledge of core concepts utilized.
